# 🎈 Balloon POP! 🎈

## Welcome to the Most POPular Game in Town! 

Are you ready for a POP-tastic adventure? Balloon POP! is here to inflate your fun and burst your boredom!

### 🎮 What's the Deal?

Balloon POP! is a fast-paced, click-happy game where your mission is to pop as many balloons as you can before time runs out. But watch out! Pop a tile without a balloon, and you might just see a frowny face that'll make you go 😢.

### 🚀 Features That'll Make You Go POP!

- 🕒 20 seconds of pure, adrenaline-pumping action!
- 🎯 Test your reflexes and eyesight - can you spot the balloons?
- 📊 Score counter to track your POPping prowess
- 😢 Cute (but sad) emojis when you miss - don't let them guilt-trip you!
- 🎉 Flashy animations that'll make you feel like you're at a balloon party!

### 🎈 How to POP

1. Clone this repository (or just download the files, we won't judge)
2. Open `index.html` in your favorite browser
3. Click "New Game" and start POPping!
4. Pop balloons to increase your score
5. Avoid non-balloon tiles or risk losing points
6. Try to get the highest score before time runs out!

### 💻 Tech Stack

- HTML5 for structure (it's the backbone of our balloon fiesta!)
- CSS3 for style (because even balloons need to look good)
- JavaScript for interactivity (it's the air that inflates our game!)
- SVG for graphics (scalable balloons, anyone?)

### 🧠 Fun Facts to Impress Your Friends

- The record for the most balloons popped by a person in one minute is 213, set by Ashrita Furman in 2006. Think you can beat that in our game?
- The largest balloon ever made was 100 feet in diameter. That's one tile we definitely wouldn't want to pop!
- The first rubber balloon was invented by Michael Faraday in 1824 for use in his experiments with hydrogen.

### 🛠️ Future POPdates (Get it? Pop + Updates?)
